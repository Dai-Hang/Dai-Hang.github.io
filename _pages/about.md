I am a full professor in the School of Computer Science at Wuhan University and an honorary research fellow at University of Glasgow. Prior to that, I was a Lecturer in Machine Learning at University of Glasgow and an Assistant Professor at MBZUAI. I was awarded a PhD in Computer Science (2019) at University of York, where I received the Overseas Research Scholarship.
